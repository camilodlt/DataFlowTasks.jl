## [Tiled factorization](@id tiledfactorization-section)

In this example we write a parallel pure `Julia` implementation of the
`Cholesky` factorization. See [this
page](https://hpc2n.github.io/Task-based-parallelism/branch/spring2021/task-basics-lu/)
for a great discussion on the subject.

!!! note
    The examples in this page were inspired by the discussion on 
    page.
